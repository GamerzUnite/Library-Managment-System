# Library-Managment-System
I have tried to create an Managment system, Using PHP,CSS,HTML and data base. This Project is not an professional level Project,but an student level project. This might help u in some projects or something else 

To see the work flow or more info about the project i will suggest u guys to read the Personal_text file to better understand the working of the file
